<p dir="ltr">I finished something&nbsp;<strong>very&nbsp;</strong>different yesterday<span>⁠&mdash; a League of Legends champion guide. I've been reading in this genre since 2011, and it was never something I saw myself creating back then. But, as the years have gone by, and my skills in both League and writing have improved, I figured why the hell not. I might use it to apply for some freelance spots, but honestly I had a lot of fun making it. I've been spamming Irelia mid in soloq, and since she seems to be gaining popularity, I figured I'd give it a shot. Plus, there were no guides out there for her in mid yet! They were all still pertaining to playing her top lane, which is a very different playstyle. Give it a glance if you want. I tried to make it as beginner friendly as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
