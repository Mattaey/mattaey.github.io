<h2>Stop Treating TikTok as a Patsy and Let Microsoft Buy Their U.S. Ops</h2>
<h5>August 3, 2020</h5>
<p>It&#39;s high time the U.S. considers what actions against China are appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I&#39;m a law student at Texas A&amp;M, concentrating and hoping to practice in Intellectual Property. The monumental problems of IP rights infringement and forced technology transfers by the CCP, are of no news to me. I admit, they are a direct cause of the bilateral trade deficit this country faces against China,. But, if this administration continues to take too strong of a position in treating them, they will cause severe side effects. From American businesses having curtailed growth, to the disruption of American consumer activities, the possible implications are far worse than the current issue at hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been seeing beginning to forge this past weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t be mistaken, Microsoft is by no means a &quot;benefactor&quot; of China&#39;s enormous consumer base in it&#39;s current state. Because of piracy, most copies of Windows, or any of the countless pieces of software in Microsoft&#39;s Office suite, are not netting profits for America&#39;s largest technology company. As Balmer has stated before, &quot;our revenue in China will be about a twentieth of our revenue in the United States,&quot; and early this year Brad Smith said the communist country was responsible for just 1.8% of the company&#39;s global revenue. Yet, when announced that the company was in talks with buying the rights to the U.S. operations of ByteDance&#39;s TikTok, the President stated less than 24 hours later that he would ban the app from the country using his executive privilege.</p>
<p>Yet, I&#39;m not here to make a political argument specifically targeting the president himself for those actions. There are reports tying his decision to the app&#39;s possible relation to the disastrously small political rally size he had in Tulsa several weeks ago, but, it takes more pushing of papers and pens to lead to that drastic level of a decision like he announced on Air Force One. Even with the fact that the U.S. military members are currently banned from using the app by their departments in mind.</p>
<p>Instead, I think it is important to look at Peter Navarro, a face familiar to many recently, as he has been leading the executive branch&#39;s team in charge of the Defense Production Act during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Navarro, as a senior official in the White House and the director of the National Trade Council, has outdated and hawkish views about how the United State&#39;s should approach China as a growing tech power in the modern global economy. His books about the country use militaristic tropes to describe their economy, and his ideas replicate a &quot;cartoonish caricature of China that he puts out&quot; in them, according to a China expert cited by ForeignPolicy. Navarro, going as far to call the country ethnocentric terms like &quot;Dragonland,&quot; is highly likely the unnamed senior official that Brad Smith cites in GeekWire. The anonymous source stated, &quot;Well, I think we&rsquo;re already in one,&quot; when asked about a possible New, twenty-first century Cold War with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is important to be clear here. If the administration thinks that part of Microsoft&#39;s deal with ByteDance, needs to include money sent to the Treasury department, then that&#39;s illegal and inappropriate. &nbsp;The United States is more of a hinderance, than a facilitator, in the transaction between these two businesses. And to ask Microsoft to &quot;reduce its exposure&quot; in China, is not just ill-informed as to how there operations occur, but it is inappropriate as a government that supposedly wants to support it&#39;s free and independent businesses.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the problem that is forced technology transfers right now, I highly advise you not to read or take advice from Navarro, and instead, look at this article from a Carnegie Melon Professor, Lee Branstetter. The views aren&#39;t extremely progressive, nor too far conservateive, and he manages to write about the Chinese people and government in a way that won&#39;t transport you to the 60&#39;s of McCarthyism and Red Scare.&nbsp;</p>
