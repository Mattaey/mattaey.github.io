<h2><em><span>Copying Lyrical Metadata</span></em></h2>
<h5>June 13, 2019</h5>
<p>I never find myself too interested in the intellectual property cases that occur outside of the gaming industry, but, a Variety article titled "Genius Accuses Google of Scraping Song Lyrics, Music Data Company Hits Back" caught my eye this week.</p>
<p>It is a weird situation that I've thought about before, especially when using Spotify. Sometimes, when listening to my playlists on Spotify's app, the album artwork rotates, and I can see lyrics and artists' anecdotes. This is all provided by Genius, a popular lyric website, and I assumed the artists&rsquo; and their labels gave permission to the website.</p>
<p>Yet, apparently, the industry doesn't normally operate like this. Google partners with a lyric publisher (who obtains the metadata as a third-party contractor) with much less scrutiny.</p>
<p>Which is fine, not every industry needs to be regulated to death, but I'm curious about the accountability. Is it even possible to sue Google (as Genius), if their third-party is using your metadata? If they obtain the rights to the lyrics of, say, <em>Like a Rolling Stone</em>, and publish with your metadata, is there a course of action?</p>
<p>They have the rights to the lyrics, and there's no tangible difference between your metadata and the original work they have the rights to. To me, this seems like a rare case of data being evaluated at more than its worth. Never thought I'd say that sentence in 2019.</p>
