<h2>How Zoom is Taking Advantage of Consumers and a Pandemic</h2>
<h5>April 1, 2019</h5>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone who&rsquo;s invested in protecting the privacy and safety granted to online citizens by the American legal system has, at one point or another, had to argue that gift&rsquo;s worth. Retorts like, why should I worry, or how does that affect me, are commonly heard and frustratingly dealt with. There are a few shockwaves in the history of consumer awareness for this legal issue that I like to think of, starting with Snowden and bureaucratic surveillance, then onto Equifax and the vulnerability of our supposedly regulated systems, to the scraping and compiling of all social data through Cambridge Analytica. During this national pandemic, I believe a fourth shockwave has occurred, and yet, not many people seem to be aware of the tremors underneath them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This wave I&rsquo;m hinting at is Zoom, the application being used by consumers across the world now, as people are forced to work from home in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It admittedly scales well, from small businesses to large corporations, and the truth is it&rsquo;s also multi-purposeful, with academia and social circles utilizing it just as well. Tonight though, when taking the time to install it on my MacBook, I was in a bit of a rush to join an important meeting as soon as I possibly could. In this hurry to install the application on my second computer, I noticed all of the steps it skipped, the steps I had anticipated as roadblocks to slow me down. An average consumer might not recognize how Zoom managed to select its own directories to unpack in, or how it managed to access permissions without ever asking for an administrative password, yet I did. And even still, it did not set off an immediate alarm to me, and I shrugged it off. It was not until later that night on Twitter, I saw OpSec and Cyber Security fiends tweeting about the same quirks I had noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So what gives? Why should I raise hell over an application skipping over a few of the rules? Especially when considering that it&rsquo;s receiving praise from most of the world&rsquo;s workforce right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For one, the techniques that Zoom uses to perform these tricks are identical to those used by malicious malware found in macOS, such as the new onslaught of key loggers and crypto miners&nbsp;that people are suffering from at an exponential rate. By skipping these steps they put the end-user at risk of being vulnerable towards other, similar future attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And second, it&rsquo;s a fishy form of impersonation. By creating a prompt, to pose as&nbsp;<em>System</em>&nbsp;instead of Zoom, they gain your password and root access at the cost of legitimacy. Apple has been in hot water with the federal judicial system over consumer data privacy recently (see GrayKey), and to prove the sector as a whole is still capable of self-regulation, they should pursue legal ramifications against a company willing to impersonate them in order to further their UX, and thus sales targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For those that want more details on the scripts that Zoom uses, I think Stephen Warwick with iMore has compiled a quality rundown with some of Felix's tweets that I saw.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imore.com/zooms-preinstallation-script-workaround-macos-very-shady">https://www.imore.com/zooms-preinstallation-script-workaround-macos-very-shady</a>&nbsp;</p>
