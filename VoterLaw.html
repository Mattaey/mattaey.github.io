<h2>Victory for Civil Rights in Tennessee</h2>
<h5>September 17, 2019</h5>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many of my friends and family who read this might not be from Tennessee, yet you probably know that I am. If you&rsquo;ve ever had the displeasure of having to hear me talk about the current condition of politics here, I&rsquo;m sorry. For me, it has been an extremely disappointing time, with our corrupt speaker Glenn Casada resining, a house member accused of sexual assault (David Byrd), and current city commissioner and candidate for mayor of Memphis, Tami Sawyer, having her vile tweets dug up days before early-voting started.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Despite all of that negativity, what was still affecting me the most was a law passed earlier this year. Back in May, our governor signed the Third-Party Voter Registration Law (HB 1079), which would&rsquo;ve been effective October of this year. A first of its kind in the country, it targeted voter registration groups and drives by implementing fines and criminal penalties for numerous new requirements. In a deeply red state, it isn&rsquo;t hard to connect the dots. Last year, the Tennessee Black Voter Project managed to register almost 100,000 voters, and there were complaints that they didn&rsquo;t submit them with enough time, or with too many errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This past week, throughout the madness that is six college classes&nbsp; and LSAT prep, was the news that the NAACP&rsquo;s and ACLU&rsquo;s lawsuit to stop this bill was successful. It was an incredible victory for civil rights across the state of Tennessee, and I was grinning as soon as I read the email. I instantly forwarded to anyone I thought was interested, and even to some who probably weren&rsquo;t. The federal judge who refused to dismiss the suit, said that the state should pursue other efforts to improve the faults in voter registration than those the bill set forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>What was mentioned in the opinion, which can be found here if you&rsquo;re interested </span><a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PI-MEMORANDUM.pdf"><span>https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PI-MEMORANDUM.pdf</span></a><span> , was something I think a lot of people might not understand at first. These organizations are targeting groups in urban areas, such as college students and low income voters. If a law like this were to pass, thousands of the voices in the Memphis community wouldn&rsquo;t be heard each election cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
