<h2>Thinking Back on Petty</h2>
<h5>April 4, 2019</h5>
<p>Since the weather is finally warming up, I shuffled my classic rock playlist on the way home from class today. As soon as&nbsp;<em>Crawling Back to You</em>&nbsp;came on, I instantly recalled my poem from a few years ago. I wrote it just after Tom Petty had passed, and man it is&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;terrible. But I was in a rut when I wrote it Freshman year, and it makes me smile looking back on it now. I vividly remember listening to Petty on the radio as a child in the 00's, and the poem at least entices that vividry. I'm going to post it here, where it is a little bit safer than my iPhone's notepad...&nbsp;</p>
