<h2>Copying Lyrical Data / Intellectual Property</h2>. June 13, 2019
<p>I never find myself too interested in the intellectual property cases that occur outside of the gaming industry, but, a Variety article titled &ldquo;Genius Accuses Google of Scraping Song Lyrics, Music Data Company Hits Back&rdquo; caught my eye this week.</p>
<p>It is a weird situation that I&rsquo;ve thought about before, especially when using Spotify. Sometimes, when listening to my playlists on Spotify&rsquo;s app, the album artwork rotates, and I can see lyrics and artists&rsquo; anecdotes. This is all provided by Genius, a popular lyric website, and I assumed the artists&rsquo; and their labels gave permission to the website.</p>
<p>Yet, apparently, the industry doesn&rsquo;t normally operate like this. Google partners with a lyric &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; who obtains the lyrical metadata as a third-party contractor, with much less scrutiny.</p>
<p>Which is fine, not every industry needs to be regulated to death, but I&rsquo;m curious about the accountability. Is it even possible to sue Google (as Genius), if their third-party is using your metadata? If they obtain the rights to the lyrics of, say, &ldquo;Like a Rolling Stone,&rdquo; and publish with your metadata, is there a course of action?</p>
<p>They have the rights to the lyrics, and there&rsquo;s no tangible difference between your metadata and the original work they have the rights to. To me, this seems like a rare case of data being evaluated at more than its worth. Never thought I&rsquo;d say that sentence in 2019.</p>
