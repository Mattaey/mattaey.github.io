<h2>Pros and Cons for the Future of Formula One</h2>
<h5>July 1, 2019</h5>
<p>After the upcoming Hungarian Grand Prix, the F1 teams will be taking their annual summer break. While the engineers will be taking time off, we can expect the team principals to be focused on the infamous 2021 regulation changes. These new rules, which are currently being negotiated with F1 and FIA, are meant to find the best middle ground between performance, entertainment and spending.</p>
<p>So what type of rules can we expect, and how will they affect us as spectators?</p>
<p>First, there is speculation that we will be seeing a new engine. F1 stepped away from the monstrous V8 to a modern turbocharged V6 in 2014, but it didn’t help fans. These engines are still heavily restricted due to emission criteria, and they are extremely intricate due to their hybrid nature. F1 states that their goal with the new engines is to make them “simpler, cheaper and noisier.” For motorsports fans, this means more competition, as the playing field between technologically advanced teams like Mercedes Benz will be evened compared to the scrapers like Haas. For an American, this is exciting, but even for fans of the middle pack teams with Honda engines, this could still be greatly beneficial for race day performance.</p>
<p>The second largest change would be to the finances of teams. It’s no secret that teams like Ferrari and Red Bull are earning insane amounts of revenue when compared to the rest, and where there’s money, there’s more podiums. To change this, F1 wants to base revenue off of placements and add incentivizations for more engine suppliers. It has already been reported by Autosport that Porsche had been eyeing a 2021 reentry, and F1 themselves stated that the proposed changes left Aston Martin interested in joining back in. New engine suppliers could be good news for teams like McLaren, who currently use Renault engines (a contract that is set to expire before the 2021 season).</p>
<p>Personally, I’m very excited for the changes, and I think they’ll breathe new life into the league. I’m most hopeful for it to help teams like Haas and Williams who are near the edge. I also think this will make the league more driver focused, instead of all of us assuming another Mercedes 1-2 each grand prix.</p>
