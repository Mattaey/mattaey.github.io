<h2>Esports is why Mixer will never be the Future</h2>
<h5>October 28, 2019</h5>
<p>I thought about writing a piece like this back in August when Ninja announced his move to Mixer. It not only baffled many of his viewers, but also left the industry questioning- how could Twitch&rsquo;s largest partner leave home? A home that ranks number 40 in global internet engagement (According to Alexa). &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t seem like the right time to talk about my speculations for Microsoft&rsquo;s new venture. As an influencer, Ninja has an incredibly large reach, which is seeable through his ad partnerships with Samsung and appearances on household television shows like <em>Family Feud</em>. I thought that this could have just been them using daddy&rsquo;s money for growth, without much of a plan. Yet today, I think I&rsquo;m wrong, and I think that they are greatly underestimating the value of esports.</p>
<p>A few developments have taken place so that my initial prejudices about the company&rsquo;s plans were proved wrong. For one, they started pulling even more Twitch superstars away. Shroud, the professional <em>Counter-Strike </em>player who quit competing in order to become one of the most skilled streamers at online shooters, is now joining Mixer&rsquo;s community. So is Gothalion, a <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Borderlands </em>streamer who announced his switch today. While I&rsquo;m sure these men were given generous amounts of money for their moves, that alone still wouldn&rsquo;t disprove my belief. In the internet age, start-ups often use VC money egregiously by throwing it at things, like water poured on a plant without proper light. It was when I realized that Mixer had enacted layoffs on much of their original programming team that I put the pieces together and saw what they were purposefully attempting to become as a company- a community first streaming website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because that phrase sits well in boardrooms of suits looking to invest their cash in anything that seems closely targeted at the crossroads of millennials and the internet. Yet, in this case, it isn&rsquo;t a great thing in my opinion. Live streaming careers may be heavily focused on and community engagement today, but that&rsquo;s not where all of the viewers lie. Twitch can thank their sitewide growth numbers to esports, as weekends throughout the year leave the site filled to the brim with concurrent viewers from different game competitions. Githyp shows Dota&rsquo;s The International 2019 raking in 1.1 million CCV, tying Twitch&rsquo;s all-time record that is held by ELEAGUE&rsquo;S Boston major for <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Millions of viewers watch competitions on Twitch, and that&rsquo;s far more than Mixer will ever see for esports.</p>
<p>Part of this goes back to what I was saying, about their purposeful plan. When laying off the freelancers they had hired for original programming, they lost their esports talk show <em>ThisWeekInEsports</em>. Neither of the previously mentioned esport tournaments, nor any of the tournaments for those games are streamed on Mixer. In fact, the Overwatch League itself has a contract reportedly worth $90m for two years (Credit to EsportsObserver and Adam Stern for that). That&rsquo;s <em>three times the amount of money</em> that is rumored to have been paid out to Ninja.</p>
<p>If you follow so far, I think you&rsquo;ll understand that the way I see it is; Twitch continues to be the home of esports and streamers, while Mixer is increasingly spending capital on becoming the home of streamers. And while many would argue that there is nothing wrong with this business plan, I just can&rsquo;t help but think of how it compares to others of the past. <em>Vimeo</em> tried to be the more professional-grade version of <em>YouTube</em>, dumping money into high-quality videos with high frame-rates. I would argue it didn&rsquo;t succeed. &nbsp;Even <em>MLG.TV </em>tried to become to the home for livestreams of esports professionals, by signing large professional stars of the time like <em>Nadeshot</em>, and it obviously failed. Esports and livestream influencers ought to be understood separately, and it&rsquo;s a great thing that the business side of our industry is finally starting to do this. Yet, I think it is important that they do not forget the symbiotic relationship between the two. They need each other for growth, and while Twitch continues to do it right, I highly doubt Mixer ever will.</p>
