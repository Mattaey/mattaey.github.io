<h2>Esports is why Mixer will never be the Future</h2>
<h5>October 28, 2019</h5>
<p>I thought about writing a piece like this back in August when Ninja announced his move to Mixer. It not only baffled many of his viewers, but also left the industry questioning- how could Twitch&rsquo;s largest partner leave home? A home that ranks number 40 in global internet engagement (According to Alexa). &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t seem like the right time to talk about my speculations for Microsoft&rsquo;s new venture. As an influencer, Ninja has an incredibly large reach, which is seeable through his ad partnerships with Samsung and appearances on household television shows like <em>Family Feud</em>. I thought that this could have just been them using daddy&rsquo;s money for growth, without much of a plan. Yet today, I think I&rsquo;m wrong, and I think that they are greatly underestimating the value of esports.</p>
